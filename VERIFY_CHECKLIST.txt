# Quick verification checklist (no changes)

## Registration
1) Visit /accounts/signup/ and create a new user
2) Confirm user is created and logged in (or redirected appropriately)

## Emails (pending + paid)
1) Place a test order via checkout
2) Verify 'pending' email is sent when order created
3) Mark order paid (thank-you page reconcile or Stripe webhook)
4) Verify 'paid' email + internal notification are sent

## CRUD (Products/Orders/Reviews)
- Products: create/edit/delete via staff UI; confirm DB updates
- Orders: view/update/delete via staff UI; confirm DB updates
- Reviews: as a purchaser, submit a review on product page; confirm it renders on FE

## Validation
- Run HTML validator on: home, product detail, cart, checkout, orders list
- Run flake8/ruff; fix any warnings

## SEO
- Check meta description tags on home/product pages
- Confirm robots.txt and sitemap.xml served in prod with canonical URLs
- Ensure external links use rel='noopener noreferrer'
- Confirm custom 404 page displays (DEBUG off)

## Navigation/UX
- Home link lands on home page (no fulfillment redirect)
- Nav distinguishes staff/customer links; check responsive layout for overflow

## Docs/Testing
- Update README with business model overview, email behavior, testing evidence
- Add ERD image/link; add marketing strategy (FB page/mockup link if required)
- Add/run automated tests: registration, checkout email path, CRUD, review display
